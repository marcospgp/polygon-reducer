# Polygon Reducer

Unity package for reducing mesh vertex counts in real time by dragging a slider.

The package can be found in the `Assets` folder.

## TODO

* Fix occasional reduction of already reduced mesh (mesh shows up as `<mesh name> (reduced)` in component's details dropdown, or even `<mesh name> (reduced) (reduced)` and so on.)
