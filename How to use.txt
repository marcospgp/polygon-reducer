How to use

Simply add the “Polygon Reducer” component to a GameObject containing the meshes you wish to optimize. The component will update all meshes in that GameObject and its children.
Once the component is added, you will be able to drag the “Reduction Percent” slider while visualizing changes in real time.

Setting up a LOD component

To set up a “LOD Group” component, simply add the “Polygon Reducer” component to different copies of the original GameObject, and drag those into the respective “LOD Group” component’s “Renderers”.
